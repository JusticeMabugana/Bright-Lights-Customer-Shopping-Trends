# Bright-Lights-Customer-Shopping-Trends

## Introduction📘 

The Customer Shopping Preferences dataset provides detailed insights into consumer behaviour and purchasing patterns. It captures key customer attributes — such as demographics, shopping frequency, preferred product categories, and responses to promotions — enabling a deeper understanding of what influences buying decisions.

By analysing these patterns, businesses can:

Optimize product offerings to better match customer needs

Improve marketing strategies by targeting the right audiences

Increase customer satisfaction and retention through personalised experiences

This dataset is a valuable resource for organisations seeking to strengthen their decision-making with data-driven insights. It supports exploratory analysis, customer segmentation, trend identification, and the development of models that enhance overall retail performance.
